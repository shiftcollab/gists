This is a repo of code snippets that are often used or play an important role in Web development at Shift Collaborative. You can use the accompanying [Knowledge Base](https://kb.shiftcollaborative.com/index.php/Useful_Code) pages to read through some of the code and find other useful pages describing how or where to use various snippets.

Some of the code is strictly for Genesis or Gutenberg or another specific environment. Use the wiki and read some of the documentation there to understand appropriate use and implementation of the code.
